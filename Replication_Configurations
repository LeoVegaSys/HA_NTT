Below are the current binlog-based replication parameters to be set in MYSQL my.cnf file


in [client] section
Comment default-character-set       -- allows mysqlbinlog to parse binlogs


in [mysqld] section
Comment slave-skip-errors=all       -- to avoid skipping errors unintentionally

Try to maintain the below configurations in one place at the end of the file

#binlog_do_db = Vegayan             -- commented as not a good idea for replication
#replicate-do-db = Vegayan          -- commented as not a good idea for replication                                 
skip_slave_start=1		            -- DO not start slave on MySQL startup
slave_skip_errors=1032		        -- Skip only update of missing records error
server-id=5			                -- server id to be taken from last octet of server IP (5 from 10.10.5.5)
log-bin=binlog			            -- sets name of binlog files
sync-master-info=1		            -- syncs master info after every transaction
sync-relay-log=1		            -- syncs slave relay log after every transaction
sync-relay-log-info=1		        -- syncs slave relay log info after every transaction
relay_log_info_repository=TABLE	    -- writes relay log info to mysql.slave_relay_log_info table
master_info_repository=TABLE	    -- writes master info to mysql.slave_master_info table
log_slave_updates=ON                -- replication from master is written to slave's binlog
innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=1    -- flush to binlog after every transaction commit
sync_binlog=1  			            -- sync binlog after each transaction
relay_log_recovery=ON		        -- reads from master binlog on restart. Avoids corrupted relay logs. Verify relay_log_purge is ON for proper working

[TO BE DECIDED] relay_log_space_limit=4G	-- limits the relay log file size, when slave IO keeps reading master logs while slave SQL lags
