For NTT, 10.10.5.2 is the primary OPS server.

Possible server states
    -   MASTER -- initial
    -   BACKUP
    -   FAULT

Processes to be monitored:
    -   Simplus
    -   MySQL

Monitoring performed by
    - Keepalived
        - Configuration maintained in Keepalived.conf

Monitoring script
    - check_service.sh
        - Checks if BOTH Simplus and MySQL processes are operational
        - Returns 0 on success / 1 on failure

Notification scripts
    - send_mail_1.py
        - Sends Notification mail on server state change
    - toggle_sro_m.sh
        - Handles transition events and actions to be performed thereof

Keepalived logic
    - Directives in global_defs apply for the entire script.
        - script_user sets the user permissions given to Keepalived to perform actions
    - track_script section provides details of vrrp script to be monitored
    - priority property in vrrp instance section sets the initial value 
    - interval denotes the time gap between script runs
    - fall denotes the number of times script has to return failure, 
        for server to transition to BACKUP
    - rise denotes the number of times script has to return failure, 
        for server to transition to MASTER
    - weight denotes the amount by which the priority is reduced (on failure)
        or increased (on success) 
        - if, for a server in MASTER state, the check script returns failure 
            fall number of times, it transitions to BACKUP state by reducing 
            priority by weight 
        - if, for a server in BACKUP state, the check script returns success 
            rise number of times, it transitions to MASTER state by increasing 
            priority by weight
    - if either of the monitored processes fails,
        - the check script is executed 6 times with an interval of 60 seconds between attempts.
    - virtual_ipaddress section stores the virtual IP, held by the MASTER server
        in the group of hosts monitored by Keepalived
    - On server state change / transition, the notify section script is run.
    - On server state change to MASTER, the notify_master section script is run.
    - On server state change to BACKUP, the notify_backup section script is run.
    - On server state change to FAULT, the notify_fault section script is run.

Monitoring script logic
    - Process IDs for Simplus and MySQL processes are identified
    - If process ID is not available for either of these processes, script returns 1 (failure)

Notification script/s logic
    - The notify script passes host IP to the mailing script
        - Other than the IP, the notify section script recieves
            - VRRP instance
            - changed / current state
            - current priority
    - The notify_master script performs the following actions:
        - Shift MySQL to Read/Write mode
        - Uncommenting crontab commands, through toggle_cron script
    - The notify_backup script performs the following actions:
        - Shift MySQL to Read Only mode
        - Commenting crontab commands, through toggle_cron script
    - The notify_fault script performs the following actions:
        - Shift MySQL to Read Only mode
        - Commenting crontab commands, through toggle_cron script
