Below are some of the frequently asked questions and their answers:

Q.  How to check read_only parameters set on MySQL?
A.  Run commands `show variables like '%read%only%';` in MySQL to get the current configuration
    Sample result:
            +-----------------------+-------+
        | Variable_name         | Value |
        +-----------------------+-------+
        | innodb_read_only      | OFF   |
        | read_only             | OFF   |
        | super_read_only       | OFF   |
        | transaction_read_only | OFF   |
        | tx_read_only          | OFF   |
        +-----------------------+-------+
    In this, we are interested in read_only and super_read_only.
    read_only applies to non-root users
    super_read_only applies to root users
    Possible values : YES / NO
    YES denotes READ ONLY mode (no writes allowed) 
    NO denotes READ WRITE mode (writes allowed)

Q.  How to stop keepalived service?
A.  Keepalived service can be stopped by running the command `systemctl stop keepalived` on the terminal
    Verify the command success by running `systemctl status keepalived`

        Active: active (running)

Q.  How to set the database to READ ONLY mode?
A.  To stop writes from normal (non-root) users , run command `SET GLOBAL read_only = ON;` in MySQL.
    To stop writes from root users , run command `SET GLOBAL super_read_only = ON;` in MySQL.
    Verify using command `show variables like '%read%only%';` in MySQL to get the current configuration

Q.  Where to check for Virtual IP assigned to current HA setup?
Q.  What is my Virtual IP?
A.  Virtual IP can be identified from the virtual_ipaddress section in the keepalived.conf located in the /etc/keepalived folder.
    This should match the IP set for VIRTUAL_IP parameter in *_ha_conf.ini located in the /etc/keepalived folder.

Q.  From where do the scripts get the MySQL credentials, if input username and password are not provided?
A.  File .my.cnf, placed in the base folder of the user running the script, contains the username, password and hostname required for MySQL queries.
    E.g., for root user, the file .my.cnf will be present in path /root. Sample given below:
        [client] 
        user=<mysql-user> 
        password=<mysql-user-password> 
        host=localhost 

Q.  How to check which server is the MASTER at present?
A.  Run command `ip a | grep <VIRTUAL IP>` on the servers. Whichever server responds with `inet ...` is the MASTER in the current configuration. 

Q.  Which script can i use to comment crontab entries?
A.  The toggle_cron.sh script, located in /etc/keepalived folder, helps to comment/uncomment current crontab entries.
    To comment crontab, run command `sh toggle_cron.sh comment`
    To uncomment crontab, run command `sh toggle_cron.sh uncomment`
    Run command `crontab -l` to verify changes are as expected.

Q.  How to check keepalived logs?
A.  Keepalived live logs can be accessed using command `journalctl -u keepalived -f`

Q.  Where can I find the keepalived logs showing server switchover details?
A.  The log location is set by the KEEPALIVED_LOG parameter in *_ha_conf.ini located in the /etc/keepalived folder.
